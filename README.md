# DNN Connect UserAccess PersonaBar extension

This PersonaBar extension allows an admin to see a user's access to a site and to (re)set their password. The displayed checkboxes for "Deleted", "Authorized", "Locked Out" etc plus all the checkboxes for site roles are clickeable whenever that option can be switched. This allows for lightning quick checking and setting of a user's access.
